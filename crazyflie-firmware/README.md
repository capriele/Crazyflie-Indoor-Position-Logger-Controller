# Crazyflie 1.0/2.0 Firmware  [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/bitcraze/crazyflie-firmware.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/bitcraze/crazyflie-firmware)

This project contains the source code for the Crazyflie 1.0/2.0 firmware. 

## Dependencies

You'll need to use either the [Crazyflie VM](https://wiki.bitcraze.io/projects:virtualmachine:index),
[the toolbelt](https://wiki.bitcraze.io/projects:dockerbuilderimage:index) or 
install some ARM toolchain.

### Install a toolchain

#### OS X
```bash
brew tap PX4/homebrew-px4
brew install gcc-arm-none-eabi
```

#### Debian/Ubuntu

Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 64b and Ubuntu 16.04 64b:

For ubuntu 14.04 :

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:terry.guo/gcc-arm-embedded
```

For ubuntu 16.04 :

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:team-gcc-arm-embedded/ppa
```

After adding the corresponding repositories, execute the following commands

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libnewlib-arm-none-eabi
```

#### Arch Linux

```bash
sudo pacman -S community/arm-none-eabi-gcc community/arm-none-eabi-gdb community/arm-none-eabi-newlib
```

#### Windows

The GCC ARM Embedded toolchain for Windows is available at [launchpad.net](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/+download). Download the zip archive rather than the executable installer. There are a few different systems for running UNIX-style shells and build systems on Windows; the instructions below are for [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/).

Install Cygwin with [setup-x86_64.exe](https://www.cygwin.com/setup-x86_64.exe). Use the standard `C:\cygwin64` installation directory and install at least the `make` and `git` packages.

Download the latest `gcc-arm-none-eabi-*-win32.zip` archive from [launchpad.net](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/+download). Create the directory `C:\cygwin64\opt\gcc-arm-none-eabi` and extract the contents of the zip file to it.

Launch a Cygwin terminal and run the following to append to your ~/.bashrc file:
```bash
echo '[[ $PATH == */opt/gcc-arm-none-eabi/bin* ]] || export PATH=/opt/gcc-arm-none-eabi/bin:$PATH' >>~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Verify the toolchain installation with `arm-none-eabi-gcc --version`

### Cloning

This repository uses git submodules. Clone with the --recursive flag

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-firmware.git
```

If you already have cloned the repo, use

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```


## Compiling

### Crazyflie 1.0

Build with:
```bash
make PLATFORM=CF1
```

or with the toolbelt

```bash
tb make PLATFORM=CF1
```

### Crazyflie 2.0

This is the dafault build so just running "make" is enough or:
```bash
make PLATFORM=CF2
```

or with the toolbelt

```bash
tb make
```

### config.mk
To create custom build options create a file called config.mk in the root folder 
(same as Makefile) and fill it with options. E.g. 
```
PLATFORM=CF1
DEBUG=1
CLOAD=0
```

# Unit testing

## Running all unit tests
    
With the environment set up locally

        make unit
        
with the docker builder image and the toolbelt

        tb make unit
        
## Running one unit test
       
When working with one specific file it is often convinient to run only one unit test
       
       make unit FILES=test/utils/src/TestNum.c

or with the toolbelt        

       tb make unit FILES=test/utils/src/TestNum.c
              
## Running unit tests with specific build settings
      
Defines are managed by make and are passed on to the unit test code. Use the 
normal ways of configuring make when running tests. For instance to run test
for Crazyflie 1

      make unit PLATFORM=CF1

## Dependencies

Frameworks for unit testing and mocking are pulled in as git submodules.

The testing framework uses ruby and rake to generate and run code. 

To minimize the need for installations and configuration, use the docker builder
image (bitcraze/builder) that contains all tools needed. All scripts in the 
tools/build directory are intended to be run in the image. The 
[toolbelt](https://wiki.bitcraze.io/projects:dockerbuilderimage:index) makes it
easy to run the tool scripts.
